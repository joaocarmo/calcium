first point (105.80175, 60.0)
last point (52.771, 310.0)



log f(t) = A + B x log t

A = -0.458188646779
B = 6.43869071324
R2 = 0.941528151585



the integral of f(t) = 625.587190353 x t ^ -0.458188646779
from 60.0s to 310.0s is

I-func = 15226.1302478



the numerical integral of the data from the first point to the last is

I-data = 14721.7991667



the total area of the rectangle which includes the
first and last points as vertices is

Area = 26450.4375



the difference in area - integral is, respectively

Area - I-func = 11224.3072522
Area - I-data = 11728.6383333
